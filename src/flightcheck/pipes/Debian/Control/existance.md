Create a Debian control file

Apphub could not find a `debian/control` file for packaging. Without this file,
we don't know package dependencies, or the source maintainer. Please create this
and resubmit your package for AppHub.

For more packaging information, you can look at these amazing resources:

- [Debian documentation](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html)
