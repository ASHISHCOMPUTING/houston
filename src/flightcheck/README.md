# houston/src/flightcheck

This folder is **DEPRECATED**. If you are looking for worker code, you should
be looking in the v2 branch [here](https://github.com/elementary/houston/tree/v2/src/worker)
on GitHub. This folder only contains a thin compatibility layer to make v2 work
with the existing v1 code.
