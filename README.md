> Houston is not even at a 1.0.0 release, yet there are many aspects that can be
approved on, especially as the idea and goal get more set in stone. This `v2`
branch is a place to talk and discuss the improvements to be made with
developers and users.

Houston is part of AppCenter, a multi component system for helping developers
and making users' life easier. Houston includes processes for building, testing,
and publishing packages, as well as the front end website.

For more information about the architecture and processes that make up Houston
please see the [architecture
file](https://github.com/elementary/houston/blob/v2/ARCHITECTURE.md).

For development information see the [various readme
files](https://github.com/elementary/houston/blob/v2/src/README.md) in the
`src/` directory.

For building and setting up your own instance read the
[install file](https://github.com/elementary/houston/blob/v2/INSTALL.md).
