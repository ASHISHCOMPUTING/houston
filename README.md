## Hacking on Houston (how-to)

We'd love your help hacking on Houston! Getting a local development environment set up is easy, and we've prepared a short guide to walk you through step-by-step. Just follow along below, and if you have any issues, don't hesitate to [ask for help](https://github.com/elementary/houston/issues/new).

We use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to simplify management of our local development environments.

Setting up Vagrant is super simple. Just download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

Then, run `vagrant up` from the root of the directory where you cloned this repository.

This will spin up an Ubuntu virtual machine as per our Vagrant file and [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) the contents of the repository directory into the VM. If you'd like to connect to the VM and poke around, you can do so with `vagrant ssh`. The synced directory lives in `~/houston`.

Now that you've got your development environment set up, you'll need to set up Houston's config file, `config.json`.

Copy the config file template:

```cp config.example.json config.json```

Then, create a GitHub OAuth application for testing Houston: https://github.com/settings/applications/new.

Name the application "Houston Local", and set the homepage and callback URLs to your local machine, like this:

`homepage`: http://localhost:3000

`callback URL`: http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback

It should look something like this:

Click Register application, and then copy and paste the newly created application's Client ID into `config.json` under `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and copy the Client Secret under `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.

Your `config.json` should now look something like this:

```json
{
  "GITHUB_CLIENT_ID": "1e9ec151a7728abaa304",
  "GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET": "9ccde02a1633b27232ee07662b7a688c43018b1f",
  "GITHUB_CALLBACK": "http://server2.elementaryos.org:3000/auth/github/callback",
  "SESSION_SECRET": "testingsessions",
  "MONGODB_URL": "mongodb://localhost/houston-dev",
  "JENKINS_ENABLED": false,
  "JENKINS_URL": "http://<jenkins username>:<jenkins user api token>@jenkins.elementaryos.org",
  "JENKINS_JOB": "deb-new-test",
  "JENKINS_SECRET": "test"
}
```

Now, re-sync the Vagrant VM with `vagrant reload`.

Open up a browser and visit http://localhost:3000, and you should see the Houston website.
